													<h2 id="a7">Test 7</h2><h3>B1</h3><p>1:D 2:С 3:A 4:F 5:G 6:E</p><h4>Tapescript&#160;&#8212; B1</h4><p>Speaker 1: My parents both worked when I&#160;was young, so they were out of the house quite a lot. I&#160;used to be looked after by&#160;my grandma and granddad. They&#160;would take me out to the park and we had a lot of fun, and then my parents would pick me up when they finished work. I&#160;was a very happy child, and I&#160;still have a great relationship with them&#160;today.</p><p>Speaker 2: I&#160;had to work really hard to make friends because we had to move house quite often. Dad&#160;was in the army, and they would send him to another job and we&#8217;d all have to follow him. It&#8217;s not easy suddenly to arrive in a new place when you&#8217;re eight, or eleven, or thirteen, but we managed. My&#160;sister was quite shy and I&#160;think it was harder for&#160;her.</p><p>Speaker 3: You wouldn&#8217;t think it to look at me now, but I&#160;was a real city kid. I&#160;love the farm, and my own children love it too, but it&#8217;s nothing like my life back then. We&#160;lived in a block of flats near a motorway. I&#160;never dreamed that one day I&#8217;d be the sort of person who likes looking after animals. I&#160;haven&#8217;t been back and I&#160;wonder sometimes whether it&#8217;s changed. I&#160;know I&#160;have.</p><p>Speaker 4: Until I&#160;was about eighteen, we lived next door to a garage and it was really noisy and smelly. There were always lots of cars around, and I&#160;used to wish that we lived in the countryside because I&#160;hated the smell of oil and petrol. It&#160;was close to Mum&#8217;s work, though, so we couldn&#8217;t really move. I&#160;was glad when I&#160;finally went away to university and found somewhere else to&#160;live.</p><p>Speaker 5: There&#8217;s a supermarket there now, but when I&#160;was little there were a few houses and a small park there. We&#160;used to play in the park and we had really nice neighbours. They&#160;knocked the houses down about ten years ago. It&#8217;s strange to think that those places only exist in my memory now. I&#160;sometimes think about those days when I&#160;visit that supermarket.</p><p>Speaker 6: Well, of course, I&#160;went to a boarding school, which meant that I&#160;slept at school, staying there even at weekends, and only went home in the holidays. I&#160;quite enjoyed it, to be honest. I&#160;had lots of friends there, and there was lots to do. But&#160;I do remember missing my family at times&#160;&#8212; well, I&#160;rarely saw them when I&#160;was a child, really.</p><h3>A1-A7</h3><p>Al:1 A2:3 A3:2 A4:3 A5:2 A6:1 A7:2</p><h4>Tapescript&#160;&#8212; A1-A7</h4><p>Salesman: Good morning, madam.</p><p>Woman: Ah, hello. It&#8217;s in the kitchen. Just&#160;go round to the back door, would&#160;you?</p><p>Salesman: Well&#8230; I&#8230; erm&#8230;</p><p>Woman: Oh. Sorry. I&#160;thought you were the plumber. I&#8217;ve been having a problem with my washing machine. Er&#8230; what did you want, Mr&#8230; er&#8230;</p><p>Salesman: Winterbottom&#8217;s the name. Irving Winterbottofn, at your service. Now&#160;today could be your lucky day, madam. I&#8217;m in your area for today only with some very special offers, the kind of offers you won&#8217;t find in the supermarkets. Now, may I&#160;ask you a question, madam? Do&#160;you own a vacuum cleaner?</p><p>Woman: I&#8230; er&#8230; well&#8230; yes, I&#160;do&#8230; but what&#8217;s that got to do&#160;with&#8230;</p><p>Salesman: That&#8217;s good, because I&#8217;m not here today to sell you a vacuum cleaner.</p><p>Woman: Aren&#8217;t&#160;you?</p><p>Salesman: Oh, no, madam. Let&#160;me ask you this. How&#160;long do you spend getting your house into such lovely condition? Three hours a&#160;day?</p><p>Woman: Oh, goodness me, no. I&#160;spend about ninety minutes a day on housework.</p><p>Salesman: How would you like to make that just thirty minutes?</p><p>Woman: I&#160;don&#8217;t know&#8230; I&#160;suppose it would be better, but&#8230;</p><p>Salesman: Your waiting is over. Let&#160;me present the Wonder Cleaner. The&#160;Wonder Cleaner doesn&#8217;t just clean your home, it cares for your home. Through the use of static electricity, it attracts the dirt and dust in an instant! For&#160;just &#163;30, or &#163;35 for the deluxe model, you too can own a Wonder Cleaner.</p><p>Woman: I&#160;don&#8217;t think so. These things never work, do&#160;they?</p><p>Salesman: I&#160;assure you, madam, that the Wonder Cleaner works and I&#8217;m willing now at no extra cost to give you a demonstration of its amazing ability&#160;to&#8230;</p><p>Woman: No, no, thank you. That&#160;won&#8217;t be necessary. I&#8217;ll tell you what, though. I&#160;do need a new duster.</p><p>Salesman: Look no further, madam. I&#160;have with me today the Super Duster, available for a special price of &#163;7, or the ordinary Dust Master for &#163;5.</p><p>Woman: Well, I&#160;find that cheaper dusters don&#8217;t do the job properly, so I&#8217;ll pay the extra two pounds and take the Super Duster, please.</p><p>Salesman: You won&#8217;t regret it, madam. Now, can I&#160;interest you in a selection of cotton tea towels?</p><h3>A8-A14</h3><p>A8:1 A9:l A10:3 All:2 A12:2 A13:1 A14:1</p><h4>Tapescript&#160;&#8212; A8-A14</h4><p>Situation 1</p><p>Woman: This isn&#8217;t the first time, is it? You&#160;go out and ask. me if I&#160;want anything, so I&#160;tell you to get some milk. Half&#160;an hour later, I&#8217;m still waiting until finally I&#160;have to go and get some myself. You&#160;come back half an hour after that and put the milk down on the table without saying a word. You&#160;should have said it was going to take you so long. That&#160;way, I&#160;could have gone myself in the first place! I&#8217;m very disappointed with you, young&#160;man.</p><p>Situation 2</p><p>Man: I&#160;went to see that new film with Vivian McDougal in it yesterday. Like&#160;most films these days, the action scenes were very loud, but I&#160;just feel like I&#8217;ve seen one too many of them. It&#160;seems like just another bank robbery movie until you get to the last five minutes, and I&#160;suppose the ticket&#8217;s worth it for that alone. I&#160;won&#8217;t give it away, but the characters aren&#8217;t what they seem. You&#160;should go and see it if you&#8217;ve nothing better to&#160;do.</p><p>Situation 3</p><p>Girl: I&#160;saw it in a magazine and it looked gorgeous! I&#160;bet you&#8217;ve had loads of people asking for it. I&#8217;ve had enough of it being on my shoulders all the time and I&#160;think it&#8217;s time for a complete change. Don&#8217;t go over the top, though&#160;&#8212; I&#160;don&#8217;t think my parents would let me get away with a pink fringe, for example. Just&#160;make sure it&#8217;s all the same length, quite short, and put blonde bits in. There&#8217;s the magazine I&#160;saw it in. Let&#160;me show&#160;you.</p><p>Situation 4</p><p>Man: It was last week. I&#160;was driving along and suddenly the car started making a funny noise, you know, like a Hunk, clunk&#8217;kind of noise. Well, I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m hopeless when it comes to these things so I&#160;took it to a garage. I&#160;was worried it might be a big thing and then he said it was going to cost over five hundred pounds! I&#160;had no way of knowing whether that was right or not, so I&#160;just told him to do it. I&#8217;m so useless! Maybe doing a course in mechanics might help save me some&#160;money!</p><p>Situation 5</p><p>Girl: It&#8217;s the way she just walked into my room without knocking that annoyed me. She&#160;wanted to borrow some money to go out with her friends. So&#160;I&#8217;m doing my homework when I&#160;suddenly hear a voice behind me saying:&#8217;Got any money?&#8217; Well, I&#160;was furious because it&#8217;s not the first time she&#8217;s come in without permission. I&#160;started shouting at her and threw her out. In&#160;fact, I&#160;did have some cash, and she could have borrowed it, even though I&#160;don&#8217;t understand why she wants to go out with that group of people. She&#160;just has to learn to knock next&#160;time.</p><p>Situation 6</p><p>Man: Ah, officer. Yes. Well, you see, the thing is I&#160;left the hospital just a few minutes ago to go home. We&#160;had a bit of an emergency and had to rush there. Anyway, what with all the panic I&#160;took a wrong turning coming back and found myself in an unfamiliar part of town and in the middle of a one-way system. And&#160;the road signs just here aren&#8217;t very clear, so that&#8217;s how it happened.</p><p>Situation 7</p><p>Boy: Newspiece it&#8217;s called. It&#8217;s quite good. It&#8217;s a children&#8217;s programme, and what they do is, each week at the end of the show they ask viewers to suggest subjects for next week&#8217;s show. The&#160;subjects have to be things in the news that week, and the show&#8217;s presenters go off and research them, you know, get interviews, that kind of thing. It&#8217;s a good way to get children involved in the news, I&#160;think.</p>
													<h2 id="a8">Test 8</h2><h3>B1</h3><p>1:G 2:D 3:В 4:С 5:E 6:F</p><h4>Tapescript&#160;&#8212; B1</h4><p>Speaker 1: Yes, I&#8217;ve basically decided what I&#160;want to do when I&#160;grow up. I&#160;really want to be a teacher in a primary school. It&#160;must be so satisfying teaching young kids to read and write and seeing them start to learn about maths and science. I&#160;know it&#8217;s hard work, and the pay&#8217;s not very good, but there are more important things than money, aren&#8217;t&#160;there?</p><p>Speaker 2: I&#8217;d really like a job where I&#8217;m going on business trips all the time. You&#160;know, going to other countries and places I&#160;haven&#8217;t been to before and staying in really nice hotels. It&#160;sounds really exciting, doesn&#8217;t it? Lots&#160;of people have jobs like that these days&#160;&#8212; and some of them earn quite a lot of money too&#160;&#8212; so I&#160;think it&#8217;s possible that I&#8217;ll be&#160;able&#160;to get a job like that when I&#8217;m&#160;older.</p><p>Speaker 3: Well, my uncle&#8217;s a travel agent. He&#8217;s got &#8217; a shop in the High Street and I&#160;often help him out at weekends. I&#8217;m learning a lot about the business&#160;&#8212; it&#8217;s really interesting&#160;&#8212; and I&#160;think it&#8217;s something I&#8217;d like to do too when I&#8217;m older. I&#160;know my uncle will be pleased if I&#160;follow in his footsteps, and I&#160;can&#8217;t actually imagine myself doing anything else, to be honest.</p><p>Speaker 4: I&#8217;d hate to have a job where you go to an office and sit at a desk all day. In&#160;fact, I&#160;don&#8217;t really want to have a job at all! I&#160;really enjoy studying&#160;&#8212; I&#160;know it sounds strange&#160;&#8212; so when I&#160;leave school, I&#8217;m going to go to university to do a degree. If&#160;I do well, and I&#160;hope I&#160;will, then I&#8217;ll stay on after my degree to do research. Who&#160;knows? I&#160;may be a professor one&#160;day!</p><p>Speaker 5: Well, I&#160;know it&#8217;s a bit of a dream, but I&#160;want to be a rock star in a really popular rock band! Everywhere I&#160;go people&#8217;ll rush up to me and ask for my autograph, and I&#8217;ll be on TV and in the newspapers all the time. It&#160;sounds really cool, doesn&#8217;t it? The&#160;problem is, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve got any talent. Maybe that doesn&#8217;t matter, though!</p><p>Speaker 6: I don&#8217;t really know what I&#160;want to do when I&#160;leave school yet, but I&#160;do know what I&#160;don&#8217;t want to do! I&#160;don&#8217;t want to get a job and do it for the next forty years! It&#160;would be so boring, wouldn&#8217;t it? So&#160;I think my plan is to do something for about ten years, and then do something totally different for the next ten years or so. I&#160;hope I&#8217;ll be&#160;able&#160;to have at least four careers before I&#160;retire!</p><h3>A1-A7</h3><p>Al:2 A2:3 A3:1 A4:1 A5:2 A6:2 A7:3</p><h4>Tapescript&#160;&#8212; A1-A7</h4><p>Librarian: Hi. Can&#160;I help&#160;you?</p><p>Woman: Er, yes. I&#8217;ve just moved to the area and I&#160;was wondering what I&#160;have to do to use the library.</p><p>Librarian: Right. Well, you have to fill in this application form here. It&#8217;s quite easy. Just&#160;put your name, address and telephone number. And&#160;we will need to see some form of identification, just to prove you are who you say you&#160;are!</p><p>Woman: What kind of thing do you need? I&#160;haven&#8217;t got my passport with me, I&#8217;m afraid.</p><p>Librarian: Have you got an electricity hill or a&#160;phone hill on you? We&#160;just need something that&#8217;s got your name and address on it, really.</p><p>Woman: I&#8217;ve got a bank statement in my bag. Will&#160;that&#160;do?</p><p>Librarian: That&#8217;s perfect. So, once you&#8217;ve filled&#160;in the form, I&#8217;ll check the details on the bank statement, and then I&#8217;ll give you a library card. That&#8217;ll allow you to take books out of the library.</p><p>Woman: Are there any rules I&#160;need to know&#160;about?</p><p>Librarian: There are a few, yes. You&#8217;re only allowed to have three books out at any one&#160;time.</p><p>Woman: I&#160;see. And&#160;how long can I&#160;keep books out&#160;for?</p><p>Librarian: You can have each book for two&#160;weeks. After that, you have to pay a small amount. It&#8217;s fifty pence per&#160;week.</p><p>Woman: That sounds reasonable, I&#160;suppose. And, do you have a music section? In&#160;the library I&#160;used to go to they had lots of CDs which you could take&#160;out.</p><p>Librarian: Yes, it&#8217;s the same thing here. The&#160;music section is on the third floor. And, once again, you can only have three CDs at any one time, and can only have them for three&#160;weeks.</p><p>Woman: Sorry, I&#160;didn&#8217;t quite understand that. Can&#160;I have three CDs and three books, or is it three of every thing in&#160;total?</p><p>Librarian: Yes, sorry. I&#160;didn&#8217;t make that very clear, did I? It&#8217;s three things in total, so that might be two books and a CD, or two CDs and one book. Does&#160;that make&#160;sense?</p><p>Woman: Yes. They&#160;had exactly the same policy at my last library, too. That&#8217;s fine. So, I&#8217;ll just fill out the form now, shall&#160;I?</p><p>Librarian: Yes, please. If&#160;you don&#8217;t&#160;mind.</p><h3>A8-A14</h3><p>A8:2 A9:3 A10:3 All:2 A12:3 A13:3 A14:1</p><h4>Tapescript&#160;&#8212; A8-A14</h4><p>Interviewer: And now as part of our regular Monday morning look at some of the things people in the local community have been doing recently, we&#8217;re joined by&#160;Alan Dawson. Alan, hi. Thanks for coming&#160;in.</p><p>Alan: No problem.</p><p>Interviewer: Now, Alan, we&#8217;re going to be seeing&#160;you soon in a major Hollywood movie, is that&#160;right?</p><p>Alan: Well, yes and no, Gloria. I&#8217;m pretty sure&#160;I will be in the film, yes. But&#160;I don&#8217;t know whether you&#8217;ll notice me. I&#8217;m not one of the stars, you see. I&#160;was an&#160;extra.</p><p>Interviewer: Okay. Let&#8217;s start at the beginning. What&#8217;s the&#160;movie?</p><p>Alan: It&#8217;s called Battle of the Giants and it&#160;stars Jeff Piper and Celia McCullum.</p><p>Interviewer: And some of the scenes were shot in the local area, were&#160;they?</p><p>Alan: Well, put it like this. Most&#160;of it was&#160;done in Hollywood, but I&#160;think people who live round here will be&#160;able&#160;to spot a few local landmarks in the battle scenes!</p><p>Interviewer: Right! So&#160;how did you get involved in the&#160;movie?</p><p>Alan: About six months ago, I&#160;saw an advert&#160;in the local paper asking for extras. They&#160;said acting experience wasn&#8217;t important, you didn&#8217;t have to be particularly good-looking, you didn&#8217;t have to have any skills really&#160;&#8212; just a desire to be in the background of a&#160;film.</p><p>Interviewer: And you applied?</p><p>Alan: Yes, I&#160;thought it sounded really interesting. You know, apart from a couple of school plays when I&#160;was a kid, I&#8217;ve never done any acting and it&#8217;s not often a chance like this comes up, so I&#160;jumped at&#160;it.</p><p>Interviewer: And what happened after you applied?</p><p>Alan: For about three months, nothing. Then, one day, I&#160;got a phone call asking me if I&#160;was still interested. I&#160;said I&#160;was, so they asked me to come to an interview the following&#160;week.</p><p>Interviewer: That interview&#160;&#8212; was that some kind of audition?</p><p>Alan: Not really. I&#160;didn&#8217;t have to do any acting or anything like that and as soon as I&#160;turned up, it became clear that I&#160;could be in the film if I&#160;wanted to be. I&#160;think the real point of it was to take my measurements so they could make a costume for&#160;me!</p><p>Interviewer: And how long after that did you have to actually act in the&#160;film?</p><p>Alan: About two weeks later. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d&#160;call it real acting, though, and I&#160;didn&#8217;t have any lines to learn. I&#8217;m in six or seven crowd scenes, just standing around really. And&#160;in one scene with a few other extras we had to run away from one of the giants.</p><p>Interviewer: Did you enjoy&#160;it?</p><p>Alan: Oh, it was great&#160;fun!</p><p>Interviewer: And have you seen the finished film&#160;yet?</p><p>Alan: No, it hasn&#8217;t been released yet. But&#160;as&#160;soon as it comes out at the cinema, I&#8217;ll be&#160;going.</p><p>Interviewer: I&#8217;ll make sure I&#160;see it too. I&#8217;ll be looking out for&#160;you!</p><p>Alan: I&#160;hope you spot&#160;me!</p>
													<h2 id="a9">Test 9</h2><h3>B1</h3><p>1:D 2:E 3:A 4:G 5:С 6:В</p><h4>Tapescript&#160;&#8212; B1</h4><p>Speaker 1: 1&#160;get on very well with my parents. Whenever I&#160;have problems with my friends or with my schoolwork, I&#160;know they&#8217;re always there to listen and give advice. They&#8217;ve taught me a lot. They&#8217;ve got a lot of experience and they&#8217;re always happy to share their knowledge with&#160;me.</p><p>Speaker 2: My mum and dad want me to go into the family business. We&#8217;ve got a restaurant and they&#8217;ve always thought I&#8217;d become a chef. They&#160;don&#8217;t like the fact that I&#160;actually want to become a policeman. We&#8217;ve had arguments about it, hut they have to realise that it&#8217;s my life and I&#160;have to make my own decisions.</p><p>Speaker 3: Mum and Dad are okay, but they seem to think I&#8217;m still a kid. When&#160;I go out with friends, I&#160;always have to be back home by&#160;ten o&#8217;clock and they call me on my mobile to check where I&#160;am. I&#160;have to ask permission for almost everything I&#160;do. It&#160;doesn&#8217;t seem fair sometimes.</p><p>Speaker 4: Work is very important to my parents and they both have very good careers. The&#160;thing is that when I&#8217;ve got problems, they&#8217;re usually too busy to sit down and talk about it. It&#160;seems like every weekend one of them is off on a business trip somewhere, and I&#160;miss them. I&#160;wish we could be together a bit more, really.</p><p>Speaker 5: My parents never had the chance of an education, and I&#160;think that&#8217;s why they want me to do well at school. That&#8217;s fine, but I&#160;wish they would relax a bit. They&#160;always want to know what grades I&#160;get each day, and I&#160;find it quite stressful. I&#160;can&#8217;t get As all the time. but I&#160;don&#8217;t think they understand&#160;that.</p><p>Speaker 6: It&#8217;s strange&#160;&#8212; I&#160;look at the relationships some of my friends have with their parents and it&#8217;s terrible. It&#160;sounds like they argue all the time, they don&#8217;t respect each other, and they don&#8217;t do things together. But&#160;that&#8217;s not what my life&#8217;s like at all. My&#160;mum and dad have always given me enough freedom, and always respected my opinion. They&#8217;re always there when I&#160;need them too. I&#160;hope I&#8217;m like Mum and Dad when I&#160;have&#160;kids.</p><h3>A1-A7</h3><p>A1:3 A2:1 A3:2 A4:1 A5:2 A6:1 A7:3</p><h4>Tapescript&#160;&#8212; A1-A7</h4><p>Builder: Hello. Mrs&#160;Horrocks? I&#8217;m Matt Riley from Riley&#8217;s Building Company. We&#160;spoke on the&#160;phone.</p><p>Mrs Horrocks: Oh, hello. Yes, I&#8217;ve been expecting you. The&#160;problem is the roof. Let&#8217;s go into the garden and I&#160;think you&#8217;ll be&#160;able&#160;to see what the problem&#160;is.</p><p>Builder: Is it this&#160;way?</p><p>Mrs Horrocks: That&#8217;s right. Let&#8217;s go round the side of the&#160;house.</p><p>Builder: Okay. Yes, a lot of people round here have had the same problem. Last&#160;week&#8217;s storm did a lot of damage and these old houses just can&#8217;t take high&#160;winds.</p><p>Mrs Horrocks: I&#160;thought I&#8217;d got away with it, but then I&#160;noticed the problem.</p><p>Builder: Yes, it&#8217;s easy to miss these things. Now, where is&#160;it?</p><p>Mrs Horrocks: If you lookup there, to the right of the chimney, you can see what&#8217;s&#160;wrong.</p><p>Builder: Yes. Some&#160;of the tiles are missing. I&#8217;ll only need a day or two to fix&#160;that.</p><p>Mrs Horrocks: Really? I&#160;thought it was a big&#160;job.</p><p>Builder: You&#8217;re lucky. Some&#160;other people have suffered a lot more damage.</p><p>Mrs Horrocks: Yes, I&#160;know. My&#160;neighbour&#8217;s house is in a terrible&#160;state.</p><p>Builder: Now, you said on the phone that you also wanted to talk about something&#160;else.</p><p>Mrs Horrocks: Yes. I&#8217;m thinking of knocking a wall down between the living room and dining room to create one large room. I&#160;wondered if you had any advice.</p><p>Builder: Well, before you make any decisions, you should draw a plan with the rooms on it. That&#160;way, you&#8217;ll get a better idea of what you want, because if you change your mind later, it could be quite expensive.</p><p>Mrs Horrocks: Yes, that&#8217;s a good idea. Should I&#160;speak to an architect?</p><p>Builder: My advice is that an architect isn&#8217;t really necessary for a job like this. You&#8217;re not changing the basic structure of the house. Let&#8217;s go inside now and I&#8217;ll give you an idea of how much it&#8217;s going to&#160;cost.</p><p>Mrs Horrocks: Right. It&#8217;s this way, through the kitchen.</p><h3>A8-A14</h3><p>A8:1 A9:1 A10:3 A11:2 A12:1 A13:3 A14:1</p><h4>Tapescript&#160;&#8212; A8-A14</h4><p>Situation 1</p><p>Woman: More and more women are playing football these days, and at my club there are lots of girls who want to get involved. The&#160;biggest problem is that newspapers and the TV just don&#8217;t pay us any attention. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s an audience out therefor a successful team like ours, but they never get to see&#160;us.</p><p>Situation 2</p><p>Woman: Tired of camping or staying in a caravan because a hotel is just too expensive? Now&#160;you too can enjoy comfort and service. Poundmaster Hotel is a new concept in hotels. Within easy walking distance of some of the best restaurants in town, Poundmaster gives you a basic hotel experience at a price you won&#8217;t believe. We&#8217;re able to do this because we know that you don&#8217;t want the swimming pools, the saunas and the hairdressing salons you might find in some hotels. We&#160;give you exactly what you do need to enjoy a good night&#8217;s&#160;sleep.</p><p>Situation 3</p><p>Man: By deciding to build the sports centre outside town, the council are making clear their commitment to developing the surrounding area. The&#160;increased tourism will be a big boost to local people, and it avoids the increase in traffic that building it in the town centre would have caused.</p><p>Situation 4</p><p>Woman: Ah,Vincent. Just&#160;the man I&#160;wanted to see. I&#160;know you&#8217;re on your lunch break, but it won&#8217;t take a minute. I&#160;don&#8217;t want to make a big issue out of this, but it&#8217;s about your time-keeping. You&#160;know I&#160;have to leave each day in the afternoon to go and see what&#8217;s happening in the other office, and I&#160;don&#8217;t want any more reports of you disappearing at four thirty. Do&#160;I make myself quite clear? Now&#160;please don&#8217;t be late back after&#160;lunch.</p><p>Situation 5</p><p>Man: I&#8217;ve been painting for a few months now and I&#160;enjoy it a lot, although you won&#8217;t see my pictures for sale in a gallery any time soon! There&#8217;s a lot of satisfaction in making something that&#8217;s attractive. You&#160;have to learn to rely on your own judgement about a picture while you&#8217;re working because no two people see things in the same way. When&#160;you finish, though, it&#8217;s rewarding when somebody else says that they like what you&#8217;ve&#160;done.</p><p>Situation 6</p><p>Woman: Well, I&#160;was driving along the road&#160;&#8212; not far from home, actually&#160;&#8212; when this idiot just pulled out right in front of me. I&#160;didn&#8217;t have any time to react and went into the side of his car. He&#160;was very apologetic, and admitted that it was his fault. I&#160;always thought that Vd panic in a situation like that, or get really angry, but to my surprise I&#160;was actually quite calm. The&#160;police arrived about fifteen minutes later and took everyone&#8217;s details, and then I&#160;went on my way, half an hour late for&#160;work.</p><p>Situation 7</p><p>Man: The argument goes that you are grown up at sixteen and you are old enough to know what you want, so why shouldn&#8217;t you be&#160;able&#160;to vote for the government you want? I&#8217;ll tell you why not&#160;&#8212; because you don&#8217;t have the maturity to make a sensible choice at that age. You&#8217;re still discovering a lot about the world and about other people, and that kind of important decision should be left in the hands of adults.</p>
